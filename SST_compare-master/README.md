This MATLAB package compares the synchrosqeezed wavelet transform, the synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, the synchrosqueezed wave packet transform, the ConceFT transform, and the multitaper time-frequency reassignment. They are stored in toolboxes 'tftb', 'sst', 'ConceFT', and 'SynLab'. Numerical implementations of these transforms are freely available at the authors' homepage. Please visit Patrick Flandrin's website for more information about the 'tftb' toolbox for the multitaper time-frequency reassignment. An introduction about the 'sst' toolbox can be found in Hau-Tieng Wu's homepage. 'ConceFT' is available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280323900_ConceFT_Matlab_Code, and the SynLab is available at https://github.com/HaizhaoYang/SynLab.

The Earth mover's distance (EMD) is applied to quantiatively compare these transforms. See the web page at 
http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ofirpele/FastEMD/ for more information about the EMD.

The codes for the comparison are stored in the folder named 'comparison'. Please run SetPath.m before running those codes.
